Raun is a tool to watch the recent changes of Wikimedia Foundation projects in (near) real time. This tool is inspired from Ronda (http://ivan.lanin.org/ronda), by Ivan Lanin. This project is started by Kenrick (User:Kenrick95).


I realised that the original Raun was a mess. At first, I made it quickly (by quickly, I also mean without proper coding style) and just for fun before I publish it to the Indonesian Wikipedia community. Hosting it in GitHub, someone noticed it and asked for localisation; I quickly made it and hence this tool grew larger and larger, but now it has come to some point that the inconsistencies among the functions made me unproductive, hence I started to "rewrite" the tool. 


How it works
--------
This tool uses Server-Sent Events to receive data every some seconds (default is 3 seconds); if browser did not support this (for example IE 11), this tool will fall back to polling every some seconds (default is 5 seconds). The tool received data from WMF Project's API via a PHP page first before being passed to the JavaScript which parses and display it to the user.

Limitations
--------
Server-Sent Events and polling heavily uses server resources. Once I ever hosted this tool at my personal website and the whole website was down (due to exceeding the hosting bandwith limit) after some hours of using this tool. Hence, I hosted it at tools.wmflabs.org.

Browser support
--------
Browsers that is supported jQuery 2.1.10; and Bootstrap 3.0
